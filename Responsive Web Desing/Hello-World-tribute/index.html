        <h2>What is "Hello World"?</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">When someone begins to study any programming language, the first thing to do when entering the code is to ask the machine to display a simple message on our monitors; as an example, it is traditional to say "Hello, world" and with this we check that the language or system we are using is working correctly. </p>
        <p class="second-paragraph">
        The origin of this custom is not very clear, researching on the Internet I find that in 1801 a French weaver and merchant named Joseph Marie Jacquard who gave his name to the first programmable loom with punched cards in which he participated in its development. It is said that Joseph, used punch cards to instruct a loom to weave "hello, world" into a tapestry.
        The tradition of using the phrase "Hello World!" as a test message was influenced during a seminar by an example program in Chapter 1.1 of the first edition of Kernighan and Ritchie's C language book, "The C Programming Language" in 1978. The example program in this book prints "hello, world" (no capitalization or exclamation point) and was inherited from an internal memo: "Programming in C - A Tutorial" from Bell Labs by Brian Kernighan from 1974.
